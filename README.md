# PrimConsTree

`PrimConsTree` is a project that:

A consensus tree in phylogenetics is a representation that summarizes the relationships among different phylogenetic trees. It helps to identify the most supported or accepted evolutionary relationships. It thus provides a more robust understanding of evolutionary history. We study the challenge of constructing a consensus tree from a set of phylogenetic trees, each with branch-length data encoding the temporal evolution of genetic mutations. Despite the richness of this temporal information, the prevailing practice in the field tends to prioritize topological features while neglecting branch length. In response, we present a new approach that incorporates both topological information and average branch length to build a more complete consensus tree. Our adaptation of the well-known Prim algorithm efficiently identifies the minimum weight of the branch length in the consensus tree. Through empirical evaluation, we show that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing methods. This research highlights the importance of considering branch-length data in consensus tree construction and makes a valuable contribution to the field of phylogenetic analysis.
